Blueprints is a generic Java graph "API":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface that binds to various graph backends (i.e. frameworks and "databases":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database). Below is a list of reasons for using Blueprints.

* Blueprints makes it relatively easy to swap in and out different graph backends. In this way, its possible to avoid "vendor lock-in":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in.
* Blueprints has connectors to popular graph databases including "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/, "OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com/orient-db.htm, "Titan":http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/, "DEX":http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/dex, and "InfiniteGraph":http://www.infinitegraph.com/.
* Blueprints has connectors to popular graph frameworks including "RDF":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore Sail and "JUNG":http://jung.sourceforge.net/.
* Blueprints graph backends work with any software written to the Blueprints API (e.g. all the tools in the "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com stack).
* Blueprints comes with a large library of utilities to make it easy to manipulate a graph.
* Blueprints has support for reading various file formats including "GraphML":http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/, "GML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language, and GraphSON.
* Blueprints, and the rest of the TinkerPop stack, is open source and free to use under a liberal "BSD license":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses.
